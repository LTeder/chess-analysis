# Chess Game Analysis

This repository generates graphical analysis of chess games.
It works through a Jupyter notebook using a bulk PGN file.
I'm using it with [Lichess](https://lichess.org/) but I imagine [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) will work as well.

## Features

- **Game Time Analysis**: Visualizes when games are played throughout the day and week

## Ideas (To-Do)

- Opening and endgame analysis
- Detecting blunders related to openings and endgames 
- Insights w.r.t. board evaluation
- Frequency plot of board for a given piece
- Pieces most captured/lost
